## Goal

I've mostly worked with monoliths/distributed monoliths and polyrepo code management. With this project, I aim to learn more "pure" microservice architecture where each service is very decoupled due to having their own databases and communicate with eachother using a message broker. I also aim to test how much C# and .NET knowledge I can learn and apply in limited time.
